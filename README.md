PROJECT OVERVIEW

My project aims to create a web app where users can select a genre (Action, Horror, Romance, Drama) and then choose between a movie or TV show recommendation within that genre. It utilizes the TMDb API to fetch recommendations and trailers.

COMPLETED FEATURES

Genre Selection: Users can select from four genres using buttons and submit their choice. Movie or TV Show Selection: After choosing a genre, users can further specify if they want a movie or a TV show recommendation. Recommendation Poster and Trailer Display: Once the user selects a genre and type, a recommendation along with its poster and trailer is displayed. Suggest Again Button: Users have the option to get another recommendation within the same genre and type. Go Back Button: Users can navigate back to the genre selection page.
